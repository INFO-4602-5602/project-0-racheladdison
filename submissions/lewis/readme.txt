Replication
  I used Tableau to do my replications of a bar chart and a scatter plot.
  It was much easier to get the data into an actual graph quickly.
  It is harder to completely customize using Tableau.
  For instance, there is a limit to the thickness of the axes.
  Other than that, manipulating the color and size of the marks was much quicker.
  The images are "anscombeI_bar.png" and "anscombe_scatter.png".
